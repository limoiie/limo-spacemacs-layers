;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `bookmark-plus-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `bookmark-plus/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `bookmark-plus/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `bookmark-plus/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:

(defconst bookmark-plus-packages
  '((bookmark+ :location (recipe
                         :fetcher wiki
                         :files
                         ("bookmark+.el"
                          "bookmark+-mac.el"
                          "bookmark+-bmu.el"
                          "bookmark+-1.el"
                          "bookmark+-key.el"
                          "bookmark+-lit.el"
                          "bookmark+-doc.el"
                          "bookmark+-chg.el")))))
